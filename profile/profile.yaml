# Introduction to academic and professional background
summary: "I am a graduate of Ontario Tech University obtaining a degree in Software Engineering with an IoT specialization. I found a passion for software development in high school when I joined a robotics team. I see software and information technology as tools in an engineer's/developer's toolbox. The language that I am most proficient in is Java which I have used for more than 8 years. Java also is the language through which I learned about data structures, OOP, version control tools, and workflow methodologies (such as Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, and XP). Other languages I have learned include Bash, SQL (Postgres, mySQL, SQLite), Python, C (C#, C++, C), and Javascript. All of these tools have helped me develop my mindset surrounding software and problems at large. Since 2016, I have spent my summers as a STEM Instructor. Teaching students at multiple education levels has given me insight into summarizing data at multiple complexity levels. With this being said, I feel my skills in the software field can bring great value to companies seeking a developer that possesses a passion for solving problems with software."

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitor Agent"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: "Implemented a usage data collecting system that collates data from nodes in a Linux Cluster. This project was programmed using PostgreSQL (PSQL), Bash, crontab, docker, and a Google Compute Engine. The PSQL instance was hosted on a docker container on one of the nodes in the cluster. This database instance held device information about each node in the cluster on one table and the usage data associated with those nodes in another table. A Bash script run using a cron job by way of crontab is used to insert values into the aforementioned usage table. The Google Compute Engine instance was used to emulate the CentOS 7 operating system to ensure that the system was compatible with RHEL and CentOS."
